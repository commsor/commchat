summary: Alright! Hi! I guess I'll start with a quick introduction I'm MFH, I do a billion things but mostly Art and Music, and I'm currently enrolled in uni studying Music Composition I joined discord back in october 2015, started a bunch of small gaming communities which never took off, then in feb. 2016 I made Art Lounge as there were no art servers at the time and I wanted an open place for people to be able to share stuff and seek improvement on their skills Ran it completely myself for like 2/3rds of a year, then got a real staff team that's been a huge help to me ever since in handling the scaling soon afterwards I made servers for both music and writing, which never took off quite as much as the art one due to some negligence, but have still formed minor communities of their own that've held out. I do hope to provide them with more treatment and goodies eventually!

### AMA Questions

What motivated you to create your servers and how did you start your server(s)

>Well I uh- guess I already answered this one but I can elaborate a bit At the time of AL, there really weren't any art servers that existed which had surprised me given the early scramble back in late 2015/early 2016 for people to make servers for everything 
and I was a freshman in high school at the time, sitting there thinking "huh, yknow I've got some experience running communities from modding large minecraft servers.. what if I did it?"
figured it'd be helpful for myself too, since I'd always wanted some real feedback on my own work and what I could do to maybe improve, given the total lack of it I've gotten from places like DeviantArt and Twitter ...ironically it ended up being the exact opposite and the server took up so much of my time for awhile that I barely drew stuff, and then even when I got back into drawing things- my status as the owner of the server meant I couldn't really get much real feedback since people were probably either afraid of ticking me off or wanted to be on my good side or something 
so if I got anything it'd be "wow nice" or something, which isn't to discredit people who like my stuff! but I've basically never gotten any real non-positive feedback from the server which leads me to wonder why that is :arrrnogood: 
SL and WL were a bit different, I knew there were existing music production servers when I made it (hell I JOINED discord from a music production skype group), but there weren't quite any that did general music appreciation as well, and all of the other servers I had seen ran things in ways I disagreed with 
so I tried making my own similar to AL in philosophy to be the "AL" of the Music servers, which I hope gets more appreciation as time goes on WL I'm... honestly not sure since I didn't check much before making it- I made it at the request of some of our members since AL in the early days had a writing channel that was frequently clogged by those actively posting 
and it sounded like a good idea, so... I gave them what they wanted! I also want to give that community more love as time passes but it's harder since I'm not as personally tied to it as AL/SL, the community really has had to run itself for awhile but I like the sentiment and the idea

---

What have been some of your most memorable moments from running these amazing servers? 

>Ohhh man this one's tough I have to say a lot of them come from the early/mid times where I was far more on active duty than passive watch and oversight fucking around with the community members, going into #general and having a good conversation on something, laughing about dumb art stuff and learning from each other 
the open environment I've pushed for has led to some rather humorous nights that remind me of the sorts of hijinks that go down in smaller private servers, but with the amount of members of a larger open community which I really enjoy, I've had people ask me before if I regret running things the way I do and I don't! 
even if it's more work in the end and has more potential for abuse, I've never preferred having things be too restricted and stifling legitimate community upbringings- whatever those may be. So yeah, I guess just those fun nights where I really got to know my community regulars better and have a good time. 
At least- that's the "memorable in a happy sense" answer, I could easily talk about all the sleepless nights and stressfully yelling at myself in the mirror and the suicide attempts but- I don't think that's what you were asking about ahah.

---

As someone who hasnt heard of them before, could you tell me about your communities? 

>the 'Lounge Network is a group of communities for content creators to have an open space to convene, share, and collaborate on stuff. it's the largest of its kind, and as such provides ample room and availability for anyone to make friends, ask questions, and potentially get them yourself of course the size also makes it somewhat harder to be "recognized" by the community or to get some ground to stand, but this doesn't make it impossible I like to equate it a bit to the "American Dream" where if you work hard enough at it-
 you'll be successful in that regard you join a small tight-knit community and without doing much- can immediately make friends and have a place to stand in AL, it's harder and takes more time, but can be just as (if not more) rewarding in the end for those that do and we always appreciate members being themselves and providing content, no matter who they are 
...unless they're frequent troublemakers aha then I might not appreciate them as much ...still think they're valuable! almost nobody is irredeemable, and sometimes the members who start off as complete troublemakers end up reforming so much I hire 'em!

---

Do you employ any kind of content moderation for your communities? If so to what extent?

>Yes I do! We obviously try to adhere to Discord's TOS as much as we reasonably can, and we try to keep content in the places it belongs- but we're not super strict about that ourselves as oftentimes the members tend to "follow" leads better than directions. so once enough people are posting a type of content in a channel, other people look and assume "yep that's definitely where this goes" without needing to be told it's not perfect and we're investigating ways of better explaining the system to people to reduce any confusion 
but it's mostly worked for a few years now As for my team itself, I'll keep it brief in saying.. I keep it brief! I've always preached that understaffing > overstaffing, and while I've been interested in having more help over time, I try not to be hasty with throwing a bunch of people together and giving them a lot of responsibilities off the bat This has it's own downsides of course, ones I've personally felt the past few years, but I'd rather deal with those slow burns than be stabbed by some situation snapping out of control

--- 

Which server do you like the most in the 3? 

>Art Lounge. no question there as a huge music guy, I really want to like SL as much as AL but it needs more work and love before it gets to that point

---

do you think your communities have evolved or changed in any way during the servers run time

>my god I could spend hours talking about this alone Yes. There has been so many "waves" and "ages" and other various classifications of groups of community members, times of various channels being more popular than others, times of rivalry, etc.. 

that we've actually got a decent amount of people interested in somehow someday putting together a "History of AL", either nonfictional or fictional Me and some of the regs were joking about making an anime out of it, and we actually did some stuff there! there was some (great) art and doodles there, and I myself did a bunch of worldbuilding (I should probably mention I also do a ton of fictional concept work, worldbuilding and jazz) But yeah- short short answer is yes, there've been a lot of changes in all aspects. Some of them for better, some for worse, but I think all of it's led to a pretty good place right now.

---

what is your community normal age group 

>Uhh, I would say roughly 15-25? We've got a sizable younger portion and some old'uns too, but at our sample size I think it mostly reflects the general distributions of Discord users and Internet-era Artists run a two-sample t-test, you'll probably get something close ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---

Which of your 5 senses would you trade for the ability to sense fear? (You have to choose one)

>...Smell's probably easiest, but if I got rid of touch I'd also be getting rid of pain and would probably go full xenomorph (which I'm assuming would be the intention of sensing fear) so.. smell, but I'll add touch to my notebook and get back to you if I ever want to abandon society and start eating people

---

Do you rely heavily on automod or do you employ a team of staff (not as in like paid, but as in do you have a staff team for moderation) to moderate your servers instead of trusting automod to make the best decision?

>0 automoderators. Ever. we're a community that especially relies on being as open as possible, so censorship should only happen in cases where it's truly needed, which is something only real staff can decide together on also robots often suck and are unreliable humans... also can suck and be unreliable, but at least they feel bad about it and try to resolve it

---

What do you look for the most when you're looking for people to help or moderator your server

>Mostly, I'm looking for people with good hearts, level heads, and a willingness to take something away from it sounds cheesy but that really is it, I need people who can make judgement calls, take responsibility, and learn from themselves/each other/the community if anything, it actually might sound a little crazy but I prefer people who aren't as experienced to people who are not necessarily because "experience brings bias" and blah blah, but because that's a big part of why I wanted a staff team actually not just to help myself but to help themselves too 
Like I mentioned before, I came from a background of moderating big minecraft servers for a few years before discord and... I was a freshman in high school when I started AL ....so I did all that MC stuff when I was a kid/early teen I had to lie to get some of the positions I had, but I got through them and gained notoriety through trying my best and learning to "read the room" whenever I could and while some of the experiences I had as a result weren't... perfect... 
OVERALL I would say it was super helpful for me! without getting too far into it, I'm actually a total social and mental wreck and from a young age was diagnosed with all sorts of disorders and could legitimately be called "socially retarded" I couldn't really hold a conversation for long or even look someone in the eye at all until about 2 years ago (and even now I still tend to look all over the place when talking to others!) 
it took many many years and thousands of hours of me standing in front of my mirror talking to myself and practicing expressing my thoughts clearer that I could start to be better fit around people So being in a position to communicate with others online frequently with my responsibility being my own communicative voice and guidance over those I moderated was a big help for me at the time both in getting those community management insights early and in my own personal sociability! 
Kind of crazy someone like me's running a big server group huh? (I certainly think so) :sweat_smile: definitely big thanks to my staff team though for all their help, If y'all are running your own communities- make sure you don't fuck up your staff team, they're your bread and butter anyway... the POINT of that was that I really want to give other people the same sort of help I got then! if any of my staff walk away with even half of the same sort of experience that I had doing moderation, I'll be happy. so while I do value experience, I think it's important to give those without experience a shot too

---

What are your future goals for the server? And what do you think about the future of discord?

>full honesty: I don't have much of a "grand plan" for the server like I used to since most of that has already happened or fell out of favor I'm very improvisational for the most part so I sort of plan around things that come up with time there's stuff like "better more consistent events" and "fixing the damn drawpile server already" that are more tangible and desirable but for the most part it's just addressing underlying issues that stem from asking "What can we do better?" or "Is anything wrong?" which sorta stems into the next thing The future of Discord, huh? 
now I've was watching the discord ecosystem pretty closely a few years back, it's slowed down the past year or two but I still try to keep my eyes places I can see things and I would've given you a different answer every month but for the entirety of 2019, I think it's all been starting to get more consistent consistently bad. 
I won't deny, I've got serious grudges against discord which could be affecting my bias here but even then I genuinely don't like the way it seems to be heading it's funny, I'm actually wearing my partner hoodie right now (not for the AMA, just have been wearin' it the past day or two as my other hoodies are dirty) and I can say I used to wear this thing with pride I've been pretty big on keeping my personal life out of discord life since I prefer them separate that way 
...but I also was discord's biggest fan up until about a year ago so I'll admit I wore it around with pride, if I got to go to public places with a lot of people I'd try and bring my partner hoodie just to walk around and be like "ooo yeah look at me the big discord man promoting the big discord aw yeah" and sometimes people would stop by me and be like "yo- discord partner??" and I'd be like "YEEE BOIIII"

How do you keep the community tightly knit as it grows bigger

>I wish I knew.
no really, the answer is you sort of don't? at least not in the same way as a small server the ideal size of a server largely depends on what you want to do with it, not all servers should try and get bigger all the time (..sadly contrary to popular belief) it really doesn't matter to you in the end but it does have an impact on the way your community shapes which I'm assuming does matter to you! 
for what I want out of AL, having as many people as feasible is an okay goal because I want to provide a wide open range for as many people to roam on as possible, having as much opportunity for connecting with people and sharing things as needed big communities can have small subsets if needed and they almost always will if you leave them alone long enough like.. 
right now the music school I'm enrolled in is fairly small and tighter-knit than most of the other schools on campus, I share a lot of classes with other people of whom I'm building connections with but it's still a part of a much larger campus so we all get the benefits of both a small community and the resources a large college campus has that's what I want with AL, to be more like DeviantArt than Artstation there are other art servers, some of which I'm in myself, that intentionally provide a smaller community and build on their relationships there for those that know Draga, I'd say she's doing hers real well, and places like that serve a good purpose for upping the attention to individuals and building lots of meaningful connections in the long run which you can do in AL! 
but it's a different purpose with a different sort of feel generally I think you can have a lot of different small places, but not a lot of big open places, but there does NEED to be a big open place so I provide the big open place :smiley: ultimately: you can keep parts of your community tightly knit with time as you form relationships with people (since that's... the whole point) but you can't make a big server feel like a small one

---

What's the worse experience you had with the server?

>(insert literally any staff/community drama here) seriously though there've been a handful of those so it's hard to pin one 
older regs would say "lol- the answer's clearly cummy being a minimod" but that was barely anything in the end in recent memory, I would say the whole infighting BS that led Draga and co. to quit and make her own splinter server was real bad, and I felt personally bad things are good now, some would say better as a result, but I felt bad for awhile at my lack of initial participation in the ordeal and possibly stopping it from going further and hurting anyone usually these sorts of drama things happen either because I'm doing too much too quickly or I'm not there to prevent it so I feel a lot of the weight once all's said and done

--- 

What's your favorite thing about running communities on Discord? and why? 

>wow why is this the hardest one for me to answer- this is like the most expected question uh.

---

It's the free Discord branded coffee for being so big, right? /s 

>I think... the best way to answer this is to equate it to...... parenting? Like asking someone what their favorite part of being a parent is like holy shit it sucks my god fuck if you run a community you should RUN GET OUT NOW

---

I relate to that too much.

>there's so much BS you have to sift through and so much responsibility and so many times you're going to sit there and think "okay yeah why am I doing this, I only have so many more breaths I'll take before I become a lifeless corpse and here I am telling the 1000th person to use the role bot instead of DM me and no we're not adding a music bot" and (at least for people who take it seriously) 

the stress that comes with dealing with it all can be overencompassing, like it can cloud your vision- your life you're taking shots in the dark for something that you have no idea will work without the cooperation of all these other individuals you can't control like puppets and why would you they're people and oh my GOD why are you even having these thoughts what is wrong with you!?!?@ǃ!?@ LOL I PINGED SOMEONE

---

they're not in here, shhh

>.... but when all's said and done you stop and take a breath and look back at what you've done you look at all the people doing what you envisioned, you see people making friends and proudly showing the things they've made people coming to your server to lay off the day's stress, entrusting your community for their time and people come up to you and thank you, because the community you provided gave them a job, or made them a friend, or got them to improve somehow and you can't help but just sit there and smile it makes the whole thing worth it like a parent watching their kid go to college and become successful on their own and that's why leadership is so important, to me and everyone really things don't get done without oversight, direction, responsibility and action for everyone to be happy and sufficient, someone's gotta be there directing the orchestra of things it can be a lonely and thankless job at times, but a well functioning system is the end-goal I've always strangely seemed to have a knack for leadership and insight into these things so... 
fuck it- guess I'll continue to carry that backpack on my shoulders I was strong enough for it, and if nobody else does- then the group doesn't have tents, food, clean water, blankets, or even toilet paper and nobody wants to go on a backpacking trip without toilet paper so yeah my favorite thing is the systems I orchestrate functioning well enough to be self-sustaining I'm just a discord/community dad basically.

---

do you ever just look at Art Lounge General chat and regret your life decisions?

>![uh](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626427713107918851/637095906994290702/unknown.png)

---

Can we ever expect to see a push to improve Sound Lounge any time soon? It's something I'd be willing to help with btw ;)

>Yes, and double yes- shoot me a DM man, lets get some ball rolling.

---

How long have you been making music for?

>composing since I was 10, I started doing electronic stuff when I was 14, but didn't really "get" into it until I was 15, so I've been producing for 4-5 years now

---

What is your favorite genre currently?

> it's a big mishmash, I listen to at least a little bit of just about everything, and the stuff I actively listen to varies hugely

I will headbang to secular renaissance choral works and then also headbang to t+pazolite's 280BPM drum spamI made this quiz on this site for a group of friends recently and I think this answers it well

---

What are your current favorite artists?

>Cesar Franck, Aleksander Vinter, Lapix, George Frideric Handel, J.S & C.P.E Bach, Rich Vreeland, Getsix, INFJ, almost everyone at NIZI-RINGO (especially Ice), t+pazolite, Thomas Tallis, Neil Cicierega, Yuka Kitamura, AdhesiveWombat, Blitz Lunar, Morgan David King, YUC'e, Niccolo Paganini, Pascal Michael Stiefel, Zach Hemsey, Mike Morasky, Kristofer Maddigan, Alon Mor, and MASTER BOOT RECORD ...to name a few

---

Have any favorite synths? ;)

>Serum is G O D T I E R obv. working with Kontakt libraries is a must for anyone serious about it
Hauptwerk is a total clusterfuck of a program to use with some of the WORST UX I've EVER seen, but damn if it doesn't sound amazing. Sytrus is trusty and true. And uh... everything else pretty much works pretty well! Like if a synth isn't obviously bad, it'll be fine

---

Where are the servers?

>Wherever the discord datacenter is. you can get into AL with https://lounge.network/ The rest stem from there. We used to have a website, it sucked

---

What is your thought on the current state of the Art Commissions Market?

>hmm, I'm not too deep into that myself, but from what I've seen artists have it way better than musicians
as long as you really apply yourself and stick your neck out, you should be able to make some bucks.  Making a living is another thing entirely but not infeasible
sorry I can't answer this one more in-depth, most of what I know is in the abstractions of commission work across mediums. like artists have it easier than musicians because art being a visual medium is inherently speedier for judgement than music- a temporal medium
you can look at someone's comm sheet and know if they're worth your money in seconds, whereas not everyone wants to sit through your whole mixtape to get a feeling for your work
also (please don't kill me for saying this) but music is harder than art, takes longer and we need to charge way more per-job than someone doing freelance art 
people don't do "music sketches" whereas an artist can give away a sketch for like 5-10$
you have no idea how many times I've talked to people about doing fairly small soundtrack/individual work commissions and I show them numbers with 3 digits as a base and they shit themselves
it's hard, takes a lot of time if you don't have all day to dedicate to it, and underselling yourself just makes you not as productive
I think Jet actually knows a bit of that, I remember doing that mee6 commission and really underselling myself as a discount and I found it hard to work on and didn't communicate that much, and what I ended up making wasn't at all what he wanted. Ended up recycling bits of that for personal music of mine but that job itself was botched aha (sorry about that btw)
 so it's important to do work that's worth your while and it's harder to find that in music, we really can't undersell ourselves
which combined with the higher degree of workload makes it much harder to make a living as a freelance musician than a freelance artist
it might seem easier because one or two jobs taking off can set you for awhile, but the jobs themselves are way harder and more involved than art jobs
so I know that stuff, but not much on art comms themselves, sorry

---

What are resources to learn more about art? (as a beginner)

>well uh- remember that part earlier where I said I was totally self-taught? yeah I uh I'm sure AL's #tutorials-resources could be of some assistance if you haven't already seen it ...and the..... internet?? Bob Ross????? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---

Where do you advertise your communities and how?

>early on, I used DSL for advertising, paying for a frontpage feature and whatnot ...Aaron's changed it up a lot though so now ironically we're not very high even if you search "Art Lounge" directly which sort of ticks me off but /shrug not like we need it at this point I tried a few other avenues another 2 discord server sites, and even Deviantart banner ads I think I did 4chan as well at some point?? 
I can't remember looked into reddit ads but never went for it the other discord server sites didn't do much at all, and DeviantArt did jack shit but was the most expensive so I of course ended that campaign early lol this was super early on so once the server had some footing I stopped caring paying Aaron and DSL was the cheapest and was far more effective so yeah I guess if you're doing ads, always try to go for the places most relevant for your specific "thing" and take whatever good deals you can find 
remember though: Ads buy you Clicks They do not buy you Stays I have to remind so many community owners I've audited this when they ask about ads Ads can get people to check your place out but if it's shitty, they're not gonna stay. Focus on making your community the best place it can be, some place people want to hang around in, BEFORE you start trying to prod your dick in the online advertising realm.

---

What is the future vision of the community? Where do you see it in 5 years? Have you thought about moving beyond Discord and creating a custom website with more functionality?

>A good one to end this on! Like I said earlier, I don't have many grand plans for the future but rather work on things as they come usually. doesn't mean I don't think about it though 5 years? Honestly I have zero clue. I'll either be in grad school or out on my own if I can some successful jobs before then and in both cases I'm not sure where I'd fit into the community's puzzle I definitely do less front work and more oversight as time has gone on and I've gotten busier so that'll probably continue I've thought for awhile about delegating each server in the community their own "leader" to manage things much in the way I do now with me sticking around as a super overlord for the network as a whole like moving from being the head of Google to Alphabet problem is I'm not sure who would do each but I'll figure it out someday I mostly always want to be around, not just because it's my baby but also to make sure that the vision remains pure as a whole and that things continue to go the way I want 'em to which sounds more authoritarian than it really is, 
I'm pretty lax and open to change improv and all that but there's a lot of core ideals I want to uphold for the entire run of the community far too many times I've watched online ecosystems, platforms, and websites decay to their own values and fall and I've spent a lot of time researching and thinking upon the subject so if there's gonna be an exception, it's gonna be mine I don't want to imagine a world where Art Lounge has a stricter set of hard rules, an autobot enforcing censorship of certain words and topics, and a limit on what people can share or how often 
We're able to push guidelines to help stray people to a better environment, but I do not want to get there by force That's cheap, easy, inauthentic, and would eventually lead to the group's demise and no matter who's in charge of the individual server itself, as long as I'm standing watch from above I won't let that happen 
as Linus Torvalds put it: We do NOT break userspace. If I ever contradict myself, do something that breaks userspace, or make a decision that inherently goes against the ideals of the server, I will correct it. and if I don't, fucking screenshot these words and slap them in front of my face- and I will. Stay true to yourselves guys; peace, and thanks for having me!

>WAIT SHIT I got so wrapped up in that part that I forgot to answer the last part shortly: Yeah I've actually thought about it the issue is that discord is... discord and everyone's on discord so 
I mean it's easy having a client purely for a creative livechat would be a lot of work and people would presumably use it for just that, you know what I mean? it's interesting but I'm not sure how it'd work out or else big art websites probably would have done similar ages ago. being on discord where everyone already is- is very convenient
...so what I REALLY would want to do is make Discord 2.0 and not fuck up... everything they've fucked up which is something... I've considered and subsequently marked down on my ever-growing list of "sort-of-insane dreams" so yeah, maybe someday I'll hit you all up on that :wink: okay now I'm done.
