### AMA Questions

Whats the biggest problem you face in your 3 bots(Vortex, GiveawayBot & Yggdrasil)? And whats the solution to that problem? Also if possible, which one is your favorite bot in those 3.

>The biggest problem would probably be just keeping them online... 99% of the time, everything is fine, but then sometimes Discord will start having connectivity issues, or I need to make a hosting upgrade, and all of a sudden there's a flood of people wondering why the bot is offline while I'm busy trying to fix the issue. 
Unfortunately, there's not really a solution to that, as the past several issues I've faced have all been things that I couldn't even fix until Discord stepped in and fixed something on their end. Also, finding time to work on everything, since I have a full-time job and a lot of projects to manage. Of the 3, my favorite is Vortex. It's the one (of those 3) that I'm most proud of (code-wise and effectiveness), and it gets used every single day on every public server I own (and most of the ones I moderate).

What would you say was the hardest part of managing and growing a community, and what do you do to combat it?

>For managing a community: It's impossible to please everyone. However, if you spend time thinking about decisions (instead of hastily making changes on a whim), your community will generally feel more comfortable. 
It can be tempting to implement whatever the latest suggestion is, but you need to take into account the perspective of people just joining the community as well as people that have been there for a long time, and balance decisions between those. For growing a community: It's very tempting to spend too much time advertising. I see this issue all the time, that people put a ton of work into trying to get people to join their server, when instead they could spend that time improving the community that already exists there! 
The most reliable way to grow a dedicated community is to be such a great place that members invite their friends. Ideally, you don't even need to advertise at all, just make sure that people who are already looking for a server like yours can find it.

What technologies do you use around you for development (languages, IDEs, VCS,... on which platform do you work?)

>At home/personal projects, I primarily write Java (using Netbeans on Windows), and for anything else (python, js, etc) I just use notepad++. At work, I write C++... and that's about all I can say about that because I do secret-level government work.

---

...and in production (cloud or baremetal, linux? - which one?)

>I run my bots and other hosted projects on linux, usually OVH (I use dedicated servers as well as some cloud VPSs), usually Debian but sometimes Ubuntu if I'm feeling lazy.

---

Do you use some form of virtualization - libvirt, vbox, lxc, containers?

>I'll occasionally use virtualbox at home, but mainly only if I want to mess around with some specific linux distro. I've used docker in the past, but I never really found it super useful for the stuff I was doing, so I don't usually use it anymore.

---

If any of these answers contain "Linux," can we get a neofetch/screenfetch?

>I have several OVH dedis, but they are all just running stock Debian 9, I don't think I even have neofetch or screenfetch installed currently.

---

What bot framework/s did/do you use to develop your bots?

>I've written bots using several API wrappers: primarily JDA, but also discord.py, discordrb, and eris. In terms of frameworks (for stuff like commands and such), I've always written my own (most of my bots use JDA-Utilities, which I wrote initially and then it became a collaborative project).

---

why did you make yggdrasil

>Spectra (another bot of mine) was the first bot to have the %speakerphone command. However, that command somewhat clashed with the purpose of the bot (being moderation and utility at the time), and a lot of people were adding the bot just for that one command. When I started making Spectra private, I moved speakerphone to a new bot so that people could still use it. Over time, I added more commands that felt in-line with a 'fun-oriented' bot, and it's grown from there!

Having created both Discord bots and large Discord servers, what would you say has been the most challenging part of your journey on Discord?

>The most challenging part is just handling change. As anything grows, the way you have to maintain it changes. With bots, you have to worry more about performance and anti-abuse, as well as putting a lot of effort into figuring out how to scale things to a large number of servers/users. With servers/communities, you need to balance what your server can offer, how many staff members you have (and how active they are), how active the community is, etc. It can be tricky to find the sweet spot that the community appeals to newcomers and old members, that people feel safe but not controlled, and that new things can be offered but without the community feeling like everything is constantly cycling.

---

If you could only have one condiment for the rest of your life what would it be?

>Some kind of sweet/honey barbeque sauce... I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.

---

Whats your biggest day to day challenge with running your community

>Keeping up with both existing projects/plans and new events/issues that arise. Very frequently I'll want to devote time to something I've been working on for the community (like organizing a new channel, or preparing an event), but it has to take a back seat to some newer pressing issue (maybe a moderation issue, or a new feature that Discord has created). I know you didn't ask this, but the way I try to deal with this by having a solid moderation or support team that can handle day-to-day activity so that administrators can focus on 'big-picture' stuff.

With the recent proliferation of botnet raids due to ease of access to them, many communities have been hit back to back. Botnets have been on Discord for years still, however. Would you say botnets played a big role when it came to the idea of developing Vortex? If so, just how much did it affect how vortex came out?

>Botnets (from a long time ago), were actually the reason I created Vortex. The first feature Vortex had was banning those mass-mention spammers (that would ping as many people as possible in one message). Over time, I added more features related to bot raids, and then moderation commands, then logs, and have kept improving all of those. I also generally try to keep up with 'current events' of how the botnets are changing so that I can add relevant features to Vortex to combat them.

What originally got you to make Spectra? What motivated you? Why did you do it? And, where did you expect it to go?

>The first bots I ever interacted with on Discord were 42 and R.Danny on the /r/Splatoon server. I had been programming for many years before seeing those bots, but I had never really gotten into making bots for chat platforms before that (and Discord was very accessible for creating bots at the time). 
Several of Spectra's features (although it was called JAGBOT at the time) are based on features from those 2 bots, although I've changed them over time, added my own flair, etc. I kept improving Spectra with features mainly for the Monster Hunter Gathering Hall; many of the commands exist almost purely for that server. As MHGH grew, some people took an interest in Spectra and wanted it for their servers as well. It kept growing mainly by word of mouth, and I joined the Discord Bots server to share what I made with other people, and to see what other people had made. 
I think that was where my ideas for 'public' bots really started; before that I hadn't really expected Spectra to do anything except help run MHGH and maybe a few other servers. Once I got into public botmaking, my goals did change slightly; I started making things more user-friendly, making things more scalable, and figuring out what features people really needed. I definitely didn't expect for anything I made to be as popular as it is today (and I even had to make Spectra private to handle scaling issues while I moved some features to other bots).

---

Why the hell did you make so many bots?

>I've always liked the idea of bots that did one thing, did that one thing really well, and looked the part. Early inspirations for this kind of behavior were bots like StahpDozAds and MathBot. These bots did exactly what you'd expect them to do, and they did those things well. Originally, I did have only one bot, Spectra, but it became difficult to balance all of its features in one bot, and it felt disheartening when someone would add it to their server and only use one of its features... almost like 'why add all of it if you only want that one part.' 
So I split up features into multiple bots so that people could add only the parts they wanted. It also felt weird to me when the same bot that was posting memes in one channel was warning you about breaking the rules in a different channel. By splitting up stuff like moderation and memes, you change the tone of how people look at the bot. (I've mainly done this because it's how I felt like it should be done, but I think popularity also supports this, as GiveawayBot is on over 300,000 servers and only does ONE thing).

---

What was the very first thing you did on Discord, before MHGH, Spectra, etc.?

>The first thing I did was make my account :P . The first server I joined was a server one of my IRL friends invited me to as a replacement for a TeamSpeak server that we had used previously. After that (several weeks of not logging in), I rediscovered Discord when I was creating MHGH - originally MHGH was going to be a TeamSpeak server, but then I remembered that Discord was the same thing but it was free, as I didn't have to host it. I also briefly had a Splatoon server but I deleted that after I discovered the /r/splatoon server.

---

What are some dead bot projects you have worked on and why are they gone now? 

>First thing that comes to mind is Jaggia, the AI learning bot. That was mostly abandoned several years ago when Discord made bot accounts separate from user accounts, which meant a bot couldn't feasibly 'blend in' with regular users. The same issue (bot accounts) was why Funky Felyne (a bot for MHGH) was shut down. BalloonBoat (a global rating system bot) never really took off due to lack of development time. Recently I shut down Where's the Party as it was only designed for Discord's Hack Week (although I might try to revive that at some point in a more-scalable way).

---

How did you market your Discord bots? What levers can you pull from a publicity and distribution perspective and how do you get adoption to become viral?

>I usually just list my bot on https://discord.bots.gg/, write up a readme/wiki on github (if it's open source), and make a basic static website (for some bots). Basically... I just make it so that if you search for my bot on google or [insert your favorite search engine here], you'll be able to find it. The most 'advertising' I do for my bots is mainly just sharing what I've made with friends in our mutual servers. 
The most common way that people learn about my bots is from being used in large servers, and since I (and the people I share stuff with) tend to run large servers, it gets spread that way. I try to keep features easy-to-use and intuitive so that people can immediately see what a bot does and how to use it. I think another reason that people are fairly quick to adopt my bots is just personal branding; I keep how things work (command structure, tone of voice, message output) fairly standard across my bots, and I put a lot of effort into keeping them online, reliable, and (as much as possible) bug-free. This means that for people that have used any of my bots before, using a different one isn't usually a difficult task.

What’s your favorite emote?

>![emote](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/269662840200101888/637156398194622495/emote.png)

Is :floppy_disk: actually your favorite bot? :EyesShaking:

>Yep. It's a combination of unique and intriguing, and the only bot (that I know of) of its kind. It's fun, it's never been a hassle to host, never really hit any growth/scaling issues, and rarely needs to be updated due to new discord features. It's also fun seeing people figuring out how to use it, while not being a huge generator of confused people.

Can you tell us the daily life of jagrosh#482

>Sure! I wake up around 7 in the morning and get ready for my day, and leave for work just before 8. I drive through security and onto the military base where I work. I head into REDACTED and start REDACTED. Normally I work on REDACTED or REDACTED. Around REDACTED, I usually REDACTED (although not every day). On REDACTED I also have a REDACTED. After 5 PM I usually head back home. In the evenings, I work on various coding projects (bots and other software), sometimes play games, and work on stuff for my Discord servers. I also try to get some exercise in there before bed (ideally around 11 PM)

---

Whats the single biggest piece of advice you'd give someone starting a new community?

>Focus on the people in the community. I mentioned it before, but I see way too many servers spending more time advertising than actually doing stuff with their community. Start conversations, play games together, and focus on what the community is about. It doesn't matter if a community is big or small; the goal should be to improve the community. Be such a great place that people in the server will want to invite their friends!

Are any of your bots on GitHub and able to be compiled/run by the general public?

>Yeah, [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot), [Phoenix](https://github.com/jagrosh/Phoenix), and [Frost](https://github.com/jagrosh/FrostCleverbot) are all designed to be self-hosted. The reason I don't do this with all my bots is usually because it takes a lot of time and effort to redesign the bot to be easy to set up, and to write detailed documentation on how to run everything. 
For example, over half of the time I spend on JMusicBot is improving the setup/user-interface for the person hosting the bot! For bots like Vortex, I'd much rather spend that time improving the bot's actual features. Also, some bots benefit more from each person running their own (JMusicBot would take a lot of resources to host a public version, and would also be running into ratelimit issues with youtube).
